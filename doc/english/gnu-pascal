It would be nice if this project could be built with GNU Pascal (GPC), due to
its portability (it exists everywhere where GCC can).  But below are some
of its limitations/incompatibilities with the way I'm currently coding.  These
might be worked around later, but for now, Free Pascal is required.

* No classes, only objects.
* No class-related functionality, like properties, method callbacks, etc.
* No SysUtils unit (can be partially faked with Dos and Strings).
* No Classes unit (threads, lists, etc).
* No Keyboard unit (can be partially faked with Crt).
* No resourcestring section (can be faked with constants).
* No GetText unit (can be faked with Intl).
* No dynamic arrays (can be faked with pointers, but that's not something that
  should be done).
* 99% incompatible strings model.
* No SAX units (can be faked with writing a wrapper for Expat).
* TRegExpr doesn't work (might be able to be faked with the built-in regular-
  expressions unit).
* Synapse doesn't work (can be faked with a wrapper for BSD sockets).
* ...
