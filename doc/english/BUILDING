Minimal dependencies:
* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>
  and GNU Pascal <http://gnu-pascal.de/> work; I hope others also
  will in the future).
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions):
  * Those included with Free Pascal plus:
    * test
    * touch
    * grep and sed
    * gettext: For translating the program into different languages.
    (The source code for the GNU versions of these programs can be
    found at <http://www.gnu.org/software/>, but I'd recommend
    using a search engine to find the appropriate versions for
    your operating system.)
* (Windows only) png2ico <http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/>
* for a GUI:
  * a C++ compiler; I'm only testing in GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>
  * wxWidgets <http://wxwidgets.org/>

After you have the dependencies, open a shell in the root source directory and
do:
make -e [rules] [environment-variables]
make -e install [environment-variables]

Helpful make rules:
clean:
  Removes all the build files generated by the compiler.
delphi
  Build with Delphi.
docs:
  Build the HTML documentation.
distclean
  Alias for clean.
fpc
  Build with Free Pascal (deprecated: use the environment variables
  USE_FPC=1 COMPILER_OVERRIDE=1 instead).
gpc
  Build with GNU Pascal (deprecated: use the environment variables
  USE_GPC=1 COMPILER_OVERRIDE=1 instead).
install
  Install the program and other files (icons, gettext catalogs, etc.).
kylix
  Build with Kylix.

Helpful environment variables:
COMPILER_OVERRIDE
  You're overriding the detected compiler.
DEFS_EXTRA
  Extra defines to send to the compiler.
DEFS_SETTINGS
  The type of settings to use:
  * SETTINGS_BIN: Dump the internal settings structure to a binary file and read
    it during startup (not recommended).
  * SETTINGS_INI: Use the Delphi/Free Pascal TIniFile class to read/write the
    settings to a .ini file.
  * SETTINGS_REG: Use the Delphi/Free Pascal TRegistry class to read/write the
    settings to the registry (or to GetAppConfigDir(false)/reg.xml on
    non-Windows versions of Free Pascal).
  * SETTINGS_TAB: Use the TTabFile object to read/write settings to a
    .tab file.
  (The default depends on the compiler and OS.)
DEFS_SOCKETS
  The sockets library to use:
  * SOCKETS_BSD: Use the low-level BSD sockets wrapper (*nix and Windows).
  * SOCKETS_SYNAPSE: Use Ararat Synapse (Delphi and Free Pascal).
  (Currently the default is SOCKETS_BSD with GPC and
   SOCKETS_SYNAPSE with FPC.)
DESTDIR
  Where to install the software.
PCFLAGS_DEBUG
  The compiler's debugging options.
PCFLAGS_EXTRA
  Extra options to send to the compiler.
R3R_DEFAULT_RULE
  The default rule to use when running the Makefile (see the
  previous section).
R3R_UI
  The user interface to use.  Look in the ./src/ui directory for
  available user interfaces.  Defaults to "tui."
RELEASE
  Set to 1 if you want a release build (no debugging information).
USE_FPC
  Use Free Pascal to compile (recommended).
USE_GPC
  Use GNU Pascal to compile.
