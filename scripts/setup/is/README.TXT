To use this program, you will need to grab the core and, if you intend to use the GUI, the wxWidgets DLL packages from the same location you downloaded the installer.  Extract them to a system location (as C:\WINDOWS\system32 or wherever you installed the program, e.g C:\Program Files\R3R 2.0\bin).  If you already have these libraries installed, you don't have to do anything.  Once installed, you shouldn't have to install them again until a major upgrade to them is made (once in a blue moon).
