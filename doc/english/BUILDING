Minimal dependencies:
* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>
  works; I hope others also will in the future).
* Pascal units: Synapse <http://sourceforge.net/projects/synalist>.
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions):
  * Those included with Free Pascal plus:
    * test
  * touch
  * grep and sed
  * gettext: For translating the program into different languages.
  (The source code for the GNU versions of these programs can be found at
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/>, but I'd recommend using a search engine
    to find the appropriate versions for your operating system)
* (Windows only) png2ico <http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/>
* for a GUI:
  * a C++ compiler; I'm only testing in GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>
  * wxWidgets <http://wxwidgets.org/>

After you have the dependencies, open a shell in the root source directory and
do:
make -e [rules] [environment-variables]
make -e install* [environment-variables]

Helpful make rules:
clean:
  Removes all the build files generated by Free Pascal, GNU Pascal,
  Virtual Pascal, Delphi and Kylix.
delphi
  Build with Delphi.
docs:
  Build the HTML documentation.
distclean
  Same as clean and also removes non-build files (generated files, mo files,
  etc.).
fpc
  Build with Free Pascal.
gpc
  Build with GNU Pascal.
install
  Install the program and other files (icons, gettext catalogs, etc.).
kylix
  Build with Kylix.

Helpful environment variables:
COMPILER_OVERRIDE
  You're overriding the detected compiler.
DEFS_EXTRA
  Extra defines to send to the compiler.
DEFS_SETTINGS
  The type of settings to use:
  * SETTINGS_BIN: Dump the internal settings structure to a binary file and read
    it during startup.
  * SETTINGS_INI: Use the Delphi/Free Pascal TIniFile class to read/write the
    settings to a .ini file.
  * SETTINGS_REG: Use the Delphi/Free Pascal TRegistry class to read/write the
    settings to the registry (or to GetAppConfigDir(false)/reg.xml on
    non-Windows versions of Free Pascal).
  * SETTINGS_TAB: Use the TTabFile object to read/write settings to a
    .tab file.
  (The default depends on the compiler and OS.)
DESTDIR
  Where to install the software.
PCFLAGS_DEBUG
  The compiler's debugging options.  Set to blank if you don't want a debug
  build.
PCFLAGS_EXTRA
  Extra options to send to the compiler.
R3R_DEFAULT_RULE
  The default rule to use when running the Makefile (see the
  previous section).
R3R_UI
  The user interface to use.  Look in the ./ui directory for
  available user interfaces.  Defaults to "tui."
USE_FPC
  Use Free Pascal to compile (recommended).
USE_GPC
  Use GNU Pascal to compile.
