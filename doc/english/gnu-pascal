Getting it to work with GNU Pascal isn't too terribly difficult.
Basically, it's just a case of make.

Requirements:
* The things listed in BUILDING.
* GP <http://fjf.gnu.de/>
* The SysUtils unit <http://www.gnu-pascal.de/contrib/chief/sysutils/>.

Notes:
* You'll need to link to Expat and perhaps some other libraries.
  Be sure to set your LDFLAGS environment variable accordingly.
* GNU Pascal limits its strings to 255 chars when no length is
  specified (unlike Free Pascal, where you can use long strings,
  which are dynamic and can be up to the size of a machine word
  (generally, that means 65534 or so characters).  This means a
  lot of feeds won't be displayed properly (Expat will quit on
  the first truncated line).
* UTF-8 seems not to work in the TUI.  Foreign feeds and
  translated interfaces may not display properly.
* This is a very early stage and there may be remaining
  crashers.  I've found several after I thought it was working
  (generally, it's related to Free Pascal being more tolerant to
  freeing unallocated memory).
* If you have Free Pascal installed, you'll need to define the
  USE_GPC environment variable.  Of course, if you have
  Free Pascal installed, you'd be better off just to use it.
* Please do read BUILDING for more information.
