The old Sourceforge download page is at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=90897>.
Look in the folder for the version and your operating system (or the source code if that's what you want).
The Windows installer is made with Inno Setup <http://www.jrsoftware.org/> (the Inno Setup license requires giving credit).

New versions are only available in source form on Github.
