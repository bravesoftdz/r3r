README for R3R

This document provides a quick overview.  See
http://sourceforge.net/projects/r3r and sites linked therein for full details.

1. LICENSE

R3R is licensed under the BSD License.  See the file LICENSE for the full text.

2. MIMIMUM REQUIREMENTS
2.1 FOR 1.2.x

* PHP 4.3 or higher.
* GTK+ 1.2.6 or higher, but lower than 2.0.
* PHP-GTK 0.52 or higher, but lower than 2.0.

2.2 FOR 2.x
2.2.1 FOR COMPILING

* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal works; I hope others also will
  in the future).
* Pascal units: Synapse and RegExp Studio.
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions): sh, make, m4, as, ld, rm, cp, ...

2.2.2 FOR RUNNING
  Hopefully, nothing.  Everything (other than built-in OS components) should
  be statically linked into the executable.

3. INSTALLING
3.1 1.2.x
3.1.1 UNIX

Grab the r3r-linux or r3r-src packages, or a copy from CVS.  Then, run
autoconf to turn configure.in into a traditional configure script.
Now, you just do your traditional ./configure && make, and then
make install as root (unless you ./configure --prefix=$HOME).
NOTE: R3R 1.2.x now resides in the R3R_1_2_x branch in CVS, so if you want
this version, you'll need to checkout via "cvs -z3 co -r R3R_1_2_x r3r".

3.1.2 INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

Get a release from the r3r-win package and run the simple installer.

3.2 2.x

The naming of the download files has changed in R3R 2.x.  It's now
r3r-<version>.<extension>, where extension is:
.tar.gz: Source code
.exe: Windows setup
.x86.package: x86 Autopackage installer

4. REPORTING BUGS, SUBMITTING PATCHES, etc.

SourceForge provides excellent facilities for this.  Read Site Docs for info.
The specifics can be found on the project home page.
NOTE: It's probably best to only report bugs in 1.2.x until 2.x reaches a
certain stability point.  Right now, 2.x has too many obvious things, that
will be fixed in the future.
Also, don't expect big new features in 1.2.x.  Work is focusing on 2.x.  But
I'll gladly investigate security issues.
