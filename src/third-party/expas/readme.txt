This contains expas.pas, the Pascal translation of James Clark's
Expat header.  It should be compatible with every version of Expat
out there (unless they decide to change functions in future
versions).  It also contains the Windows DLL (version 1.95.2), used
in the Windows installer.  Full source code can be obtained from
http://www.libexpat.org/ .
