For information on installing from source, get
r3r-<version>.tar.gz and then read the file BUILDING.

For installing on x86 Linux, run r3r-<version>_<ui>.x86.package.
See <http://www.autopackage.org/howtoinstall.html> if you need help
installing it.

For installing on Windows, run r3r-<version>_<ui>.exe (created with
Inno Setup; sure, you don't need to know that, but I'm just giving
the developer of the program some credit).
