1. LICENSE

R3R is licensed under the BSD License.  See the file LICENSE for the full text.

2. BUILDING

See the file BUILDING for instructions on how to build.

3. INSTALLING

See the file INSTALLING.

4. REPORTING BUGS, SUBMITTING PATCHES, etc.

SourceForge provides excellent facilities for this.  Read Site Docs for info.
The specifics can be found on the project home page.
NOTE: It's probably best to only report bugs in 1.2.x until 2.x reaches a
certain stability point.  Right now, 2.x has too many obvious things, that
will be fixed in the future.
