1. LICENSE

R3R is licensed under the Artistic License.  See the file Artistic for the
full text.

2. INSTALLING ON UNIX

Grab the r3r-linux or r3r-src packages, or a copy from CVS.  Then, run
./r3r-installer.

3. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS

3.1

Get a release from the r3r-win package and run the simple installer.

3.2

If there's none available:

3.2.1

The UNIX installer can be used if you have the necessary utils (GNU ash,
fileutils, etc).  Having a UNIX directory structure (namely, /home/$USER and
/usr/local directories) will make it easier to use.

3.2.2

Create your own installer.  Get Inno Setup, change setup.iss so that
Inno Setup knows where to find the required files on your computer, and run
setup.iss with Inno Setup.  More information about creating the setup and
making it downloadable by anybody is available on the project home page.

4. REPORTING BUGS, SUBMITTING PATCHES, etc.

SourceForge provides excellent facilities for this.  Read Site Docs for info.
The specifics can be found on the project home page.
