Minimum requirements:

* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>
  works; I hope others also will in the future).
* Pascal units: Synapse <http://sourceforge.net/projects/synalist> and
  TRegExpr <http://regexpstudio.com/TRegExpr/TRegExpr.html>.
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions):
  * Make and sh
  * binutils: as, ld
  * file utils: basename, cp, dirname, install, mv, rm, touch
  * grep and sed
  * gettext: For translating the program into different languages.
    (You can configure with --disable-nls if you don't have gettext)
  (The source code for the GNU versions of these programs can be found at
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/>, but I'd recommend using a search engine
    to find the appropriate versions for your operating system)
* Perl <http://cpan.org/ports/index.html>: For text manipulation of the
    source files during compilation.
* (Windows only) png2ico <http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/>

After you have the dependencies, in a shell in the root source directory, do:
./configure [options]
make [rules] [macros]
make install [macros]

For configure options, type "./configure --usage".
Helpful make rules:
clean-alt:
  Cleans all the files build files generated by Free Pascal, GNU Pascal,
  Virtual Pascal, Delphi and Kylix.
delphi
  Build with Delphi
gpc
  Build with GNU Pascal
install-docs:
  Install the documentation on *nix systems.
install-win32:
  Install the documentation on Windows.
install-strip:
  Installs, strips and compress the files
install-win32
  Install on Win32
kylix
  Build with Kylix
vp
  Build with Virtual Pascal
win32
  Make with Free Pascal for Windows

Helpful macros:
INSTALL
  BSD-compatible install program.  If you don't have one, you can use X.org's
  install.sh
  <http://cvs.freedesktop.org/*checkout*/xorg/xc/config/util/install.sh>.
  GNU install may be called ginstall on some systems.
PC
  The Pascal compiler to use.  Defaults to fpc, though rules for other
  compilers override it.
PCFLAGS_DEBUG
  The compiler's debugging options.  Set to blank if you don't want a debug
  build.
PERL
  The Perl executable to use.
