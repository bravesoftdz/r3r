README for R3R

This document provides a quick overview.  See
http://sourceforge.net/projects/r3r and sites linked therein for full details.

1. LICENSE

R3R is licensed under the BSD License.  See the file LICENSE for the full text.

2. MIMIMUM REQUIREMENTS
2.1 FOR 1.2.x

* PHP 4.3.x or 5.1.x.
* GTK+ 1.2.6 to 1.2.10, or 2.6+.
* PHP-GTK 0.52 or higher.

2.2 FOR 2.x
2.2.1 FOR COMPILING

* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>
  works; I hope others also will in the future).
* Pascal units: Synapse <http://sourceforge.net/projects/synalist> and
  TRegExpr <http://regexpstudio.com/TRegExpr/TRegExpr.html>.
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions):
  * Make and sh
  * binutils: as, ld
  * file utils: basename, cp, dirname, install, mv, rm, touch
  * grep and sed
  * gettext: For translating the program into different languages.
    (You can configure with --disable-nls if you don't have gettext)
  (The source code for the GNU versions of these programs can be found at
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/>, but I'd recommend using a search engine
    to find the appropriate versions for your operating system)
* Perl <http://cpan.org/ports/index.html>: For text manipulation of the
    source files during compilation.

2.2.2 FOR RUNNING
Hopefully, nothing.  Everything (other than built-in OS components) should
be statically linked into the executable.

3. INSTALLING
3.1 1.2.x
3.1.1 UNIX

Grab the r3r-linux or r3r-src packages, or a copy from CVS.  Then, run
autoconf to turn configure.in into a traditional configure script.
Now, you just do your traditional ./configure && make, and then
make install as root (unless you ./configure --prefix=$HOME).
NOTE: R3R 1.2.x now resides in the R3R_1_2_x branch in CVS, so if you want
this version, you'll need to checkout via:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/r3r checkout -r R3R_1_2_x -P r3r

3.1.2 INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
Get a release from the r3r-win package and run the simple installer.

3.2 2.x

The naming of the download files has changed in R3R 2.x.  It's now
r3r-<version>.<extension>, where extension is:
tar.gz: Source code
exe: Windows setup
x86.package: x86 Autopackage installer

The Windows and Linux installers are installed simply by executing the file
(Linux users may need to make the file executable).

The source code will extract to a new directory.  In that directory,
do the traditional:
./configure
make
make install

The configure file is not an autoconf configure.  It's just a perl script
that will output a message and then generate the Makefile.
Other files that need generated will be generated during the make process.

On Non-Unix-like operating systems, some environment variables might need
changed.  Special win32 targets (win32, install-win32, uninstall-win32, etc)
exist for convenience.

4. REPORTING BUGS, SUBMITTING PATCHES, etc.

SourceForge provides excellent facilities for this.  Read Site Docs for info.
The specifics can be found on the project home page.
NOTE: It's probably best to only report bugs in 1.2.x until 2.x reaches a
certain stability point.  Right now, 2.x has too many obvious things, that
will be fixed in the future.
Also, don't expect big new features in 1.2.x.  Work is focusing on 2.x.  But
I'll gladly investigate security issues.
