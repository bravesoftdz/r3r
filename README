README for R3R

This document provides a quick overview.  See
http://sourceforge.net/projects/r3r and sites linked therein for full details.

1. LICENSE

R3R is licensed under the BSD License.  See the file LICENSE for the full text.

2. MIMIMUM REQUIREMENTS

* PHP 4.3.x or 5.1.x.
* GTK+ 1.2.6 to 1.2.10, or 2.6+.
* PHP-GTK 0.52 or higher.


3. INSTALLING
3.1 UNIX

Grab the r3r-linux or r3r-src packages, or a copy from CVS.  Then, run
autoconf to turn configure.in into a traditional configure script.
Now, you just do your traditional ./configure && make, and then
make install as root (unless you ./configure --prefix=$HOME).

3.2 INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
Get a release from the r3r-win package and run the simple installer.

4. REPORTING BUGS, SUBMITTING PATCHES, etc.

SourceForge provides excellent facilities for this.  Read Site Docs for info.
The specifics can be found on the project home page.
NOTE: Don't expect big new features in 1.2.x.  Work is focusing on 2.x.  But
I'll gladly investigate security issues.
