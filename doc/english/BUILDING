Minimal dependencies:
* Pascal Compiler (currently, only Free Pascal <http://www.freepascal.org/>
  works; I hope others also will in the future).
* Pascal units: Synapse <http://sourceforge.net/projects/synalist>.
* Unix tools (preferably, the GNU versions):
  * make and sh
  * echo, expr, mkdir, test (if these aren't built-in in your sh)
  * binutils: as, ld
  * file utils: basename, cat, cp, dirname, install, mv, rm, touch
  * grep and sed
  * gettext: For translating the program into different languages.
  (The source code for the GNU versions of these programs can be found at
    <http://www.gnu.org/software/>, but I'd recommend using a search engine
    to find the appropriate versions for your operating system)
* (for a GUI) Lazarus <http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/>
* (Windows only) png2ico <http://www.winterdrache.de/freeware/png2ico/>

After you have the dependencies, open a shell in the root source directory and
do:
make -e [rules] [environment-variables]
make -e install* [environment-variables]

Helpful make rules:
clean:
  Removes all the build files generated by Free Pascal, GNU Pascal,
  Virtual Pascal, Delphi and Kylix.
delphi
  Build with Delphi
docs:
  Build the HTML documentation
distclean
  Same as clean and also removes non-build files (generated files, mo files,
  etc.).
fpc
  Build with Free Pascal for *nix
fpc-win32
  Build with Free Pascal for Windows
gpc
  Build with GNU Pascal
install
  Install the program and other files (icons, gettext catalogs, etc.) on *nix.
install-docs
  Install the documentation on *nix.
install-docs-win32
  Install the documentation on Windows.
install-strip
  Same as install and also reduces the size of the program in its installed
  location.
install-win32
  Same as install, but for Windows.
kylix
  Build with Kylix
vpc
  Build with Virtual Pascal

Helpful environment variables:
DEFS_EXTRA
  Extra defines to send to the compiler.
DEFS_NET
  The networking library to use (defaults to -dUSE_SYNAPSE).
DEFS_SETTINGS
  The type of settings to use:
  * DEFS_BIN: Dump the internal settings structure to a binary file and read
    it during startup.
  * DEFS_INI: Use the Delphi/FreePascal TIniFiles class to read/write the
    settings to a .ini file.
  * DEFS_REG: Use the Delphi/FreePascal TRegistry class to read/write the
    settings to the registry (or to GetAppConfigDir(false)/reg.xml on
    non-Windows versions of FreePascal).
  (The default depends on the compiler and OS.)
INSTALL
  BSD-compatible install program.  If you don't have one, you can use X.org's
  install.sh
  <http://cvs.freedesktop.org/*checkout*/xorg/xc/config/util/install.sh>.
  GNU install may be called ginstall on some systems.
PCFLAGS_DEBUG
  The compiler's debugging options.  Set to blank if you don't want a debug
  build.
PCFLAGS_EXTRA
  Extra options to send to the compiler.
R3R_DEFAULT_RULE
  The default rule to use when running the Makefile (see the
  previous section).
R3R_UI
  The user interface to use.  Look in the ./ui directory for
  available user interfaces.  Defaults to "tui."
prefix
  Where to install the software.  Defaults to /usr/local (or for the *win32
  rules, C:\Program Files\R3R).
